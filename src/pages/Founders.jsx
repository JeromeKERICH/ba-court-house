          <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto space-y-6 text-gray-700">
            <p className="text-lg">
            It started with frustration and street food. One founder was watching an oil company waste millions because their reports didn't match what field workers actually needed. The other saw tech teams build perfect solutions that made nurses' jobs harder, not easier. Over plates of suya in Lagos traffic, they realized the problem: Africa was full of smart ideas that kept failing in execution. 
            There were plenty of analysts and consultants, but not enough people who could bridge the gap between boardroom strategies and real-world operations.
            <br/>
            Their breaking point came when a female entrepreneur showed them her third bank rejection - not because her business was bad, but because she couldn't translate her vision into terms bankers understood. In that moment, BA CourtHouse was born: no fancy offices, just two professionals with 22 years of combined scars across oil & gas, tech, and finance, determined to fix what everyone else was overcomplicating. That first client got funded in three weeks. Today, whether it's helping hospitals implement tech that actually helps nurses or 
            turning messy operations into investor-ready systems, their approach stays the same: if it doesn't work for the people using it, it doesn't work.
